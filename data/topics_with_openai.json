They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.\n  Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the\n  U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products. But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt\n  them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be\n  their gain. The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on\n  imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in\n  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not\n  to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost. Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs\n  at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms\n  said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the\n  new taxes.",
